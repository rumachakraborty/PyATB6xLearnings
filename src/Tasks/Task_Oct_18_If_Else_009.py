 ## An API sometimes fails due to network delays.

# Write a program to retry the API call 3 times until the response code becomes 200.
# If it still fails after 3 tries, print a failure message.

# Hint: Use a while loop with a counter.

# Expected Output Example:
# Attempt 1: Response 500
# Attempt 2: Response 200
